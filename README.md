# Mixed-Signal-SoC-design-Marathon-using-eSim-SKY130
This marathon is based on eSim, an open-source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. 
# Abstract
A window comparator circuit, also called window detector circuit determines whether an unknown input is between two precise reference threshold voltages or not. This work presents a window comparator connected to a 4-bit binary counter. The output of counter goes to a multiplexer as selection lines to direct one of 16 data sources into a single destination. The window comparator circuit, analog part, and counter along with multiplexer, digital circuit, make a mixed signal circuit which is the goal of this project to meet. The simulation is implemented in eSim using SKY130 technology.
